/**
 * `sandkit.engine.api` — composed engine API namespaces.

 * **Internal API.** Prefer {@link sandkit.api} when a public method exists.
 * Engine methods usually take **game state as the first argument** (`args[0]`);
 * remaining `args` entries are method-specific. Names are shorter than the
 * public `sandkit.api` surface. Engine-only members below are stubs until confirmed.
